Welcome to my repository! Here, you'll find a detailed outline and comprehensive notes for the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) exam. These notes are based on the course I completed and are designed to help you prepare effectively.

Below, you'll find all the essential information about the course and exam:

- **Course:** [Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) with Practice Tests](https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests)
- **Exam:** [Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-kubernetes-administrator-cka/)

> **NOTE** I've also included links to the Labs to assist you, as this exam is predominantly hands-on. Please note that you need to have purchased the course and created a KodeKloud account to access them.
